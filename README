The files contained in this repository are meant to act as a source for projects worked on outside and inside of classes 
at both Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Ridgewood High School. For which academic institution the program was created
for and how the program can be used will be listed in the readme file for that program. This is meant to provide sample work
that I have done to any who want to see it.
