The files contained in this repository are for a Long-short term memory neural network created for
ECSE-4900 or Multidisciplinary Capstone Design at RPI. Practice files and the actual neural network
that I created are here along with the required data and data manipulation programs I created.
This isn't the full project, just the parts that I worked on that aren't privated due to a privacy
policy.
This was done in python.
