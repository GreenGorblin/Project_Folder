The files contained in this repository are meant to act as a source for projects worked on outside and inside of classes 
at both Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Ridgewood High School. For which academic institution the program was created
for and how the program can be used will be listed in the readme file for that program. This is meant to provide sample work
that I have done to any who want to see it.

This list is still a work in project, due to how I picked up github not very long ago due to using RPI services exclusively before
recent months, so here is what has been uploaded so far and for which institution that item was for, if at all, and which course it was done for:
-Neural Network Machine Learning Project, RPI for ECSE-4900
