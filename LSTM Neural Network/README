This folder contains the practice files and actual files for the long short-term memory neural network developed
for the Multidiscipline Capstone Design (ECSE-4900) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The project description was
based around sales forecasting methods with my method being a LSTM neural network. The files created for that project
are posted in this folder and can be viewed with some sample output plots also posted in this folder. Due to how at the
time these were created I started out with very little neural network knowledge and limited user interface resources, the
output plots are simplistic matplotlib plots and there are some rookie mistakes in all of the model files, ranging from the
final model to the first practice model. Due to how this project was heavily based around the M5 Kaggle competition, these
files are able to be uploaded privately without breaking any non-disclosure documents for the course due to how I took it
in the Fall 2021 semester, but just in case please do not share these files to the public. The following can be used for reference
to tell which .py files are which, if it isn't clear:
Practice LSTM neural network with one input time series: LSTMTEST_OLD
Practice LSTM neural network with multiple input time series: LSTMTEST
Final LSTM neural network with multiple input times series based around M5 competition data: YetAnotherLSTMTest
Modified M5 competition data used in the final neural network: sales_train_evaluation_summed_by_day
Program modifying the modified M5 competition data further before using it in the final LSTM neural network: Data_Setup

Please make sure that you have the required libraries in python installed before running the neural network. Due to issues
noticed when switching Tensorflow types mid project, please use Tensorflow without GPU support for the practice models to work
properly or at all, since they did not work with the GPU variant of Tensorflow.
